JavaScript has come a long way from being solely a front-end language. With Node.js, you can harness the power of JavaScript on the server-side, enabling you to build fast and scalable backend applications.

```jsx
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.set('view engine', 'ejs');

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  const data = {
    title: 'Welcome to Node.js',
    message: 'Build powerful backend applications with JavaScript.',
  };
  res.render('index', data);
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

Node.js's non-blocking, event-driven architecture makes it ideal for building real-time applications, APIs, and microservices. It's no surprise that many companies, including Netflix and PayPal, have adopted Node.js for their backend development.

Whether you're building RESTful APIs, handling WebSocket connections, or creating full-stack applications, Node.js empowers you to leverage your JavaScript skills on both the client and server sides. Join the Node.js community and explore the endless possibilities of server-side JavaScript development.
